This directory contains data based on the University of Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Database (referred to here as XRMB).

The original XRMB manual can be found here:  http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/gafos_downloads/ubdbman.pdf

We acknowledge John Westbury for providing the original data and for permitting this post-processed version to be redistributed.  The original data collection was supported (in part) by research grant number R01 DC 00820 from the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communicative Disorders, U.S. National Institutes of Health.

The post-processed data provided here was produced as part of work supported in part by NSF grant IIS-1321015.

Some of the original XRMB articulatory data was missing due to issues such as pellet tracking errors.  The data has been reconstructed in using the algorithm described in this paper:  

Wang, Arora, and Livescu, "Reconstruction of articulatory measurements with smoothed low-rank matrix completion," SLT 2014.

The data provided here has been used for multi-view acoustic feature learning in this paper:
